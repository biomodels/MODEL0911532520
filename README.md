# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Oscillatory behavior in enzymatic control processes.**   
Goodwin BC. _Adv Enzyme Regul_ 1965;3:425-38
[5861813](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5861813) ,  
**Abstract:**   
The demonstration of negative feedback control processes operating at the
molecular level in cells is one of the most significant developments in modern
biology. The phenomena of feedback inhibition and feedback repression, whereby
enzymatic activities are controlled at the level of the enzyme and the gene,
respectively, provide a firm experimental basis for the construction of
dynamic models which represent the fundamental regulatory activity of cells.
The behavior of these and other molecular control circuits thus constitutes
the basis of cell physiology, and in effect provides the physiologist with his
elementary units of function. The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the
type of periodic behavior which can arise in model systems incorporating the
essential control features of enzymatic regulatory processes, and to discuss
the significance of oscillatory motion in relation to the organization of
cellular processes in time.
